# melee-pc

## OpenSmash browser fork

This fork adds the OpenSmash browser platform to
[999sian/melee-pc](https://github.com/999sian/melee-pc), preserving its Git history.
The `opensmash/browser` branch is consumed by an exact revision pin in OpenSmash.
See [browser build and upstream sync instructions](platforms/browser/README.md)
and [validation results](platforms/browser/validation/README.md).

## Upstream project

**Beta, for testing only.** "melee-pc" is a working name. Online play with
rollback netcode is planned and **not implemented yet**.

A native PC port of Super Smash Bros. Melee (NTSC-U 1.02), built from
[doldecomp/melee](https://github.com/doldecomp/melee) on top of
[aurora](https://github.com/encounter/aurora) (GX/OS/PAD/DVD/CARD/THP
compatibility layer with a WebGPU backend) and SDL3. Same approach as
[dusklight](https://github.com/TwilitRealm/dusklight).

You need your own disc image. No game data ships here.

## Features

- Native Linux, Windows and Android (arm64) builds, rendered through
  Dawn/WebGPU (Vulkan, D3D12) and SDL3.
- RmlUi launcher with disc selection and SHA-1 verification against the Redump
  database before boot.
- In-game settings overlay on **F1**, with the game paused underneath.
- Internal resolution from Auto to 10x native (6400x4800).
- Post-processing shaders: area sampling, CRT scanlines, vibrant.
- 4x MSAA and anisotropic filtering up to 16x.
- Gamepad remapping, including C-stick directions, saved per device.
- Software AX audio mixer with the game's aux busses and reverb.
- Dolphin-compatible `.gci` memory cards.

## Status

Works end to end:

- Boot, opening movie, memory card create/load, title, attract demos.
- Main menu, VS Mode, character and stage select; human vs CPU matches play.
- 1-P Classic and Adventure run to completion, with results and score saved.
- Training, Stadium (Target Test, Home-Run Contest, 10-Man Melee).
- Trophy gallery, Event Match list, Icicle Mountain scrolling.
- Music and sound effects, saves.

Not done: online play with rollback netcode, All-Star (unreachable until the
roster is unlocked), widescreen camera and HUD, macOS.

## Building

Needs GCC (the game code relies on `scalar_storage_order("big-endian")`, which
only GCC implements), CMake 3.25+, Ninja, and a Vulkan driver. Aurora fetches
its own Dawn/SDL3/nod prebuilts.

```sh
cmake -B build -G Ninja
ninja -C build
```

No disc data is needed to build. The two HSD font atlases are pixel data from
the retail DOL, so instead of being committed they are read out of the disc
you supply, at boot (`src/pc/discfont.c`).

The release artifacts are produced by the same scripts CI runs, so they work
locally too. Windows cross-compiles from Linux with MinGW-w64; Android needs an
NDK (`ANDROID_NDK_HOME`) and a JDK 17.

```sh
tools/package_linux.sh      # dist/Melee-x86_64.AppImage + tarball
tools/package_windows.sh    # dist/Melee-Windows-x86_64.zip
tools/build_android.sh      # dist/Melee-Android-arm64.apk (signed release)
```

## Running

```sh
build/melee                              # open the launcher
build/melee <disc.iso|.gcm|.ciso|.rvz>
```

Only **Melee USA revision 2 (NTSC-U 1.02, GALE01)** is supported. A valid disc
path on the command line boots straight in; a missing or invalid one returns to
the launcher. Settings and the selected path live in `launcher.cfg` in SDL's
`melee-pc` preference directory (usually `~/.local/share/melee-pc`).

Verification reads the disc through nod, compressed images included, and compares
SHA-1 against the
[Redump DAT](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/blob/master/metadat/redump/Nintendo%20-%20GameCube.dat):
`d4e70c064cc714ba8400a849cf299dbd1aa326fc`, 1,459,978,240 bytes. It supports
progress and cancellation, and is not cached between launches. Unverified images
still play.

Keep `resources/` next to the binary when distributing. The bundled Liberation
Sans fonts are covered by `resources/FONT-LICENSE.txt`.

## Controls

Keyboard: arrows = stick, IJKL = C-stick, X = A, Z = B, C = X, V = Y, Q/E = L/R,
Tab = Z, Enter = Start, TFGH = D-pad. Gamepads work through SDL.

| | Keyboard | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Navigate | Up/Down, Tab | D-pad or left stick |
| Adjust | Left/Right | D-pad left/right |
| Change tab | Left/Right on the tab strip | L/R shoulders |
| Select | Enter | A |
| Close overlay | Escape, F1 | B, Start, Back |

## Settings overlay

**F1**, or Back/Select on a gamepad, opens the overlay. The game pauses while it
is open.

- Display: fullscreen/windowed and VSync apply immediately. `MELEE_VSYNC`
  overrides the saved preference.
- Internal resolution and UI scale are sliders. UI scale covers 75% to 150%.
- Post-processing picks the presentation shader and applies immediately.
- Anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering apply on the next launch. MSAA offers
  only off and 4x because WebGPU guarantees sample counts 1 and 4.
- Audio: master volume, mute, FPS counter, all immediate.
- Controls remaps a gamepad. Pick the port, select a GameCube button, then press
  the physical button. Escape cancels, Restore resets the port. Back cannot be
  bound since it opens the menu. Sticks and triggers remap the same way, and a
  direction accepts either a stick axis or a button.

Melee's own menu sounds play in the overlay. Bindings are stored in aurora's
per-device `.controller` files; everything else shares `launcher.cfg`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MELEE_SEED=<n>` | Deterministic RNG for the attract demo. |
| `MELEE_HEAP_CHECK=1` | Canaries on every heap allocation, checked each frame; aborts at the first stomp. |

## Porting notes

Disc data stays big-endian in memory and is described with `DISC_STRUCT` and
`DISC_PTR` (see `src/pc/disc.h`). Structs mapping archive contents are byte-swapped
on access by GCC, disc pointers are 32-bit slots relocated to host addresses, and
MEM1 is mapped at `0x80000000` so those slots always fit. The whole 4 GB range is
game-addressable through `-no-pie` with text at `0x10000000`.

Bug classes that keep coming back when bringing up a new scene:

- Runtime structs have 8-byte pointers, so any hard-coded GameCube offset
  (`(u8*)gp + 0xD8`, `memzero(p, 0x74)`, padded overlay structs) has to become a
  real field or `sizeof`.
- Statics are not adjacent on x86-64. A cast to a bigger struct to reach the next
  static must name the neighbour instead.
- Bitfields are LSB-first. Unions overlaying bitfields with an integer view need
  `DISC_STRUCT` on the union and every nested struct.
- `UNK_T` is `void*`, so unnamed words are 8 bytes. Inside a union view that is a
  layout change; retype numeric ones `u32`.
- Motion-variable unions (`Fighter::mv`) have the same problem one level down: the
  game writes one view and reads another, so a pointer inside a view shifts every
  member below it. Where no position survives, move the field into `Fighter`.
- Retail `GXEnd` is empty and the decomp omits it, but aurora's `GXEnd` submits
  the draw. Every `GXBegin` needs one.
- `Mtx` is 48 bytes and `Mtx44` is 64; `MTXOrtho` and `MTXPerspective` take `Mtx44`.
- `bool` in a decomp signature usually means "int the decompiler could not name".
  Under `_Bool` every value above 1 clamps, so an index or scene id silently
  becomes 1.
- Walking an object as `void**` and indexing by GameCube word number scales by 8,
  so `p[0x14]` for byte 0x50 lands at byte 160. Index by name.
- Japanese string literals are Shift-JIS at runtime; the build passes
  `-fexec-charset=CP932`.

Three harnesses find the next batch. Validate any sweep by re-introducing one
known-true positive and checking the count moves by exactly one.

- Whole-tree warning sweep: compile every TU for real (`-Wreturn-type` is not
  emitted under `-fsyntax-only`), strip the build's `-Wno-all -Wno-extra`, pass
  `-fdiagnostics-color=never`, and add `-Warray-bounds=2 -Wstringop-overflow=2
  -Wformat-overflow=2 -Wbool-operation`.
- `python3 tools/lint_sweep.py` compiles every game TU with `-m32 -DLINT`, which
  turns `ASSERT_SIZE` and `ASSERT_OFFSET` into real checks against the GameCube
  ABI. A failure means the struct reconstruction is wrong, not the port.
- `python3 tools/compile_check.py <files|dirs>` syntax-checks with the build's
  exact flags. Fast, so use it before a full build.

For "does this union view still alias on LP64", build one probe TU of the real
headers twice with the project's flags, native and `-m32`, then diff member
offsets and sizes out of DWARF (`gdb -batch -ex 'ptype /o T'`). Compare byte-range
intersections, not start offsets.

## Tools

- `tools/run.sh <disc>` runs under gdb and dumps all threads on a crash.
- `tools/demo_run.sh <seed> [secs]` enters the attract demo and reports survival
  or crash frames; `tools/demo_sweep.sh <seeds...>` batches it.
- `tools/devctl.py key|hold|shot` drives and captures the game window under X11.
- `tools/run_dbg.sh <disc>` adds a FIFO/PAD state dump on interrupt.

`import -window` can keep returning the last composited frame under Xwayland while
the game presents normally, which looks like a freeze and is not one. `devctl.py
shot` detects two identical captures and nudges the window; when a screenshot and
a backtrace disagree, believe the backtrace.

## Layout

- `src/melee`, `src/sysdolphin` - game code from the decomp (upstream commit in
  `src/UPSTREAM_COMMIT`), adapted to the PC data model.
- `src/pc` - platform layer: main, OS/VI/GX glue, keyboard, audio mixer, THP,
  vertex-array sizing.
- `extern/aurora` - vendored aurora with local changes.

## License

Three situations, spelled out in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md): the decompiled
game code in `src/melee` and `src/sysdolphin` is **not licensed** and remains
the property of its copyright holders; the port code in `src/pc`, `tools`,
`platforms`, `cmake` and `.github` is **GPL-3.0-or-later** ([COPYING](COPYING));
bundled third-party components keep their own licenses. Because the game code
cannot be relicensed, the repository as a whole is not distributable under the
GPL. No game assets are in this repository.
