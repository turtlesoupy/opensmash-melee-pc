"""Throw malformed UDP datagrams at a netplay instance and require it to shrug.

                      [--disc ../melee.ciso]

Datagrams: random/known magic bytes, bogus version and session ids, counts up to
255, INT32_MIN/MAX frames, reliable len 0..65535 with truncated or oversized
bodies, every length 0..1500. --bind sends from a fixed source port; --launch
starts one instance with MELEE_NET pointed at that port so the garbage passes
the peer-address check and reaches the parser (the instance idles at frame 0
waiting for its "peer"). Pass = process alive afterwards, no DESYNC / "peer
silent" / "peer left" / crash in the log; rejected-packet lines
("net: dropped ..." / "net: incompatible version ...") are counted and shown.

--session HEX (--launch: "auto" reads it from the instance's "net: rollback
with ... session" line) crafts every datagram with that session id, --player
(the remote player, default 1) and --version (default: PC_NET_PROTO_VERSION as
read from src/pc/net.h), so they pass the
header gate and the frame-range/count validation of input packets, acks and
the reliable channel is what gets hit: first/count/newest at the RING/2
boundary around the instance's frame, INT32 extremes, count 0/16/17/255,
bodies one byte short. No BYE and no foreign version in this mode (either
ends the session and the rest would be inert). We also play peer: the
instance's own input packets tell us its newest frame and we feed neutral
pads up to it, so it keeps ticking instead of stalling out.

--attack ack-overshoot is not fuzzing but the deterministic regression for the
ack sanity check in on_ack(): play peer for a window, measure the pads the
instance sends, send ONE ack for its newest frame + --ack-offset (default
1000, a frame it never sent), measure again. An instance that accepts it keeps
counting frames and keeps sending packets, with no pads in them, for the rest
of the session. The mixed stream only catches that by luck, so this mode is
its own pass/fail line.
