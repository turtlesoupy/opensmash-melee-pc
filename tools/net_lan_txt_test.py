"""TXT-record contract of the LAN lobby, checked against a running instance.

    tools/net_lan_txt_test.py [--exe build/melee] [--disc ../melee.ciso]
                              [--port 42100] [--work /tmp/net_lan_txt]
                              [--c-harness] [--only NAME,NAME]

One instance is launched with MELEE_LAN_TEST=1 (src/pc/vi.c: it joins the
lobby at boot and never starts a match), then this script speaks mDNS to it
on 224.0.0.251:5353 with IP_MULTICAST_TTL 0, so every crafted frame is looped
back to this host and never reaches the network. It asserts:

  announce    the announced TXT carries the key set src/pc/net_lan.c:211-223
              writes, with our own game port, and disc= agrees with the
              "lan: announcing ... disc X" boot line
  ptr         a PTR question for _meleepc._udp.local. is answered
  accept      a well-formed record is listed ("lan: found")
  goodbye     the same record with ttl 0 drops it ("lan: lost")
  rev         another rev= is listed as incompatible, both values named
  disc        another disc= is listed as incompatible, both values named
  reject      every rejection class of parse_txt() produces its own
              "lan: dropped a malformed record: <reason>" line, exactly once
  full        PC_LAN_MAX_PEERS+1 peers -> "lan: lobby full" once

Each case counts its log line before and after and requires the count to move
by exactly the expected amount, so a case that asserts a rejection also proves
the record was not accepted, and vice versa.

The crafted records are built from the instance's OWN announced key set, so
this runs against whatever protocol version the binary implements: the cases
that need keys the running binary does not announce (disc=, and the rejection
classes that only exist with it) are reported as SKIP rather than failed. A
build predating the disc= key therefore still checks announce/ptr/accept/
goodbye/rev/full and the rejection classes it already had.

No compatible state=starting record naming the instance's own install id is
ever sent: that is the one record that would make it dial out (net_lan.c:993).

--c-harness runs only tools/test_net_lan_txt.c, which covers parse_txt() and
the peer table with no game process and no mDNS traffic at all.
