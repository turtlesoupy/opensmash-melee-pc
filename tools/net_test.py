Direct mode (default): MELEE_NET=127.0.0.1:<peer> + MELEE_DEBUG_VS=1, Start
pressed twice through MELEE_KEY_FIFO (title, then straight into Link vs Mario).
--lan: both instances walk the real menus into the LAN lobby (VS Mode -> ONLINE
-> LAN PLAY), Start on one elects the host, then the CSS by sweeping the
portrait grid and the SSS by one Start on its random cell; needs the shared LAN
free (coordinate with anyone else in the lobby).
--scenes: --lan plus the rest of the set - match, out of it by L+R+A+Start,
results, CSS, SSS, rematch - and the cross-log assertions in check_scenes()
(same CSS frame and seed, identical SSS picks twice, same stage archives).
--oom FRAME: MELEE_NET_SIM_OOM_FRAME on A, so its first
snapshot at/after FRAME fails like a realloc would; check_oom() asserts the
session drops to lockstep and finishes anyway. --disconnect: B SIGKILLed
mid-match (no BYE), asserting A times the peer out within the documented 7 s
and keeps its frame loop running. --stall SECONDS: B SIGSTOPped mid-match,
asserting the reconnect window (net.c:639-832) survives an interruption
inside it and expires with status 2 past it. --fuzz: tools/net_fuzz.py
hammers instance A's port during the match.

Each instance runs until MELEE_NET_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES (net.c) prints
"net: test done", or the test times out. Pass = both done, exit 0, no DESYNC,
no "peer silent", no rollback lost. Exit code 0 on pass, 1 on fail.
Logs: <work>/a.log, <work>/b.log. tools/net_acceptance.py imports parse_args()
